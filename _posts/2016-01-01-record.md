Records any inbound stream. The record command allows users to record a stream that may not yet exist. When a new stream is brought into the server, it is checked against a list of streams to be recorded.

Streams can be recorded as FLV files, MPEG-TS files or as MP4 files.

| **Parameter Name**  | **Mandatory** | **Default Value** | **Description**                          |
| :-----------------: | :-----------: | :---------------: | ---------------------------------------- |
|   localStreamName   |     true      |      *null*       | The name of the stream to be used as input for recording |
|     pathToFile      |     true      |      *null*       | Specify path and file name to write to   |
|        type         |     false     |        mp4        | “ts”, “mp4” or “flv”                     |
|      overwrite      |     false     |     0 *false*     | If false, when a file already exists for the stream name, a new file will be created with the next appropriate number appended. If 1 (true), files with the same name will be overwritten |
|      keepAlive      |     false     |     1 *true*      | If 1 (true), the server will restart recording every time the stream becomes available again |
|     chunkLength     |     false     |   0 *disabled*    | If non-zero the record command will start a new recording file after ChunkLength seconds have elapsed |
|     waitForIDR      |     false     |     1 *true*      | This is used if the recording is being chunked. When true, new files will only be created on IDR boundaries |
|     winQtCompat     |     false     |     0 *false*     | Mandates 32bit header fields to ensure compatibility with Windows QuickTime |
| dateFolderStructure |     false     |     0 *false*     | If set to 1 (true), folders will be created with names in YYYYMMDD format. Recorded files will be placed inside these folders based on the date they were created |

An example of the record interface is:

``` 
record localStreamName=video1 pathtofile=/recording/path/fileName type=mp4 overwrite=1
```

This records the local stream named video1 to directory /recording/path in mp4 format with fileName and overwrite enabled.

**Example:**

**API Call:**

``` 
record localStreamName=testpullstream pathtofile=../media/testRecord type=mp4 overwrite=1
```

**JSON Response:**

``` 
{
"data":{
    "chunkLength":0,
    "computedPathToFile":"..\/media\/testRecord.mp4",
    "configId":12,
    "dateFolderStructure":false,
    "hasAudio":true,
    "keepAlive":true,
    "localStreamName":"testpullstream",
    "mp4BinPath":"..\\evo-mp4writer.exe",
    "operationType":7,
    "overwrite":true,
    "pathToFile":"..\/media\/testRecord ",
    "preset":0,
    "type":"mp4",
    "waitForIDR":false,
    "winQtCompat":true
},
"description":"Recording Stream",
"status":"SUCCESS"
}
```

The JSON response contains the following details about recording a stream:

- data – The data to parse
  
  - chunkLength - The length (in seconds) of each playlist element
  - computedPathToFile – The path and file name of the recorded stream
  - configID – The configuration ID for this command
  - dateFolderStructure – If true, will organize record chunks by date
  - hasAudio – Indicates if the recorded stream has audio, false if none
  - keepAlive – If true, the stream will attempt to reconnect if the connection is severed
  - localStreamName – The local name for the stream
  - mp4BinPath-??
  - operationType – The type of operation
  - overwrite – If true, files with the same name will be overwritten
  - pathToFile – Path to the folder where recorded files will be written
  - preset - ??
  - type – Type of file for recording. Either \`flv\`,\`ts\`, or ‘mp4’
  - waitForIDR – If true, new files will only be created on IDR boundaries
  - winQtCompat – If true, andates 32bit header fields to ensure compatibility with Windows QuickTime
  
- description – Describes the result of parsing/executing the command
  
- status – `SUCCESS` if the command was parsed and executed successfully, `FAIL` if not
