While the EMS has a **great** User Interface, users typically interact with the EMS through the Run-Time API. This API, which is used by the UI, provides a whole suite of ways to interact with the EMS.Â  It can be used to create custom User Interfaces, hook the EMS up to existing systems, integrate it with other pieces of software and much more!
