This document describes theApplication Programming Interface (API) and the Event Notification Systempresented by the EvoStream Media Server (EMS). The API provides the ability to manipulate the server at runtime.  The server can be told to retrieve or createnew streams, return information on streams and connections, or even start orstop functional services.  The EventNotification System provides a means for the EMS to alert users of certainevents that occur within the EMS, such as a new stream is created, a stream hasbeen dropped, server stopped, etc. The EvoStream Media Server API and EventNotification System allows users to tightly integrate with the server withouthaving to write native plugins or modules.
